# unicorn template

Simple template for [unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn). This is an example of how [CPM](https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake) can be used to manage dependencies in your CMake project.

See `CMakeLists.txt` for details, it is much simpler than you might expect.

## Building

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

That's it!
